Project SPICES is focused on Integrated Wellness. Our Project focuses on people currently facing mid-life crisis.

This project involved making a machine learning model that could predict the stressors among people in their mid-life ages. The analysis are then taken into consideration by the company to help them elevate. Project SPICES and their services focuses on helping the employees. The stress causes are used to help emplyees improve their overall performances and be more productive at work.

We used Logistic Regression Model for this business problem, which gave an accuracy of 98% on the making predictions with the test data. However, only a few hyperparameters have been used to prevent overfitting of data into the model. Accuracy tests like F1 Score and Confusion Matrix also brings high predictions.

Other models we used to compare with Logistic Reg were KNN and Random Forest. The results were not as high and accurate compared to the former.
